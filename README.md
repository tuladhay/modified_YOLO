# modified_YOLO

This is a modified version of YOLO2. It has few more outputs in the final convolutional layer such that it can detect pose x, y, z of a single object. I was using this to get bounding boxes around CargoDoor, and estimate the pose of the door from the camera. The data collection and application implementation was in ROS Indigo.
